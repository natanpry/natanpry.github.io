	<h3> Use Granola </h3>
	Don't be afraid! Instead of using cereal with milk you can just use some nice and healthy granola! <br>
 Its healthier and won't give you cancer like half of the worlds cereal companies will!

	<h3> Use Chips </h3>
	Even though this is definetly less healthy and will probably give you a heart condition within the first 3 months of doing it, it is still a nice way to eat cereal without the cereal. <br>
Just pour the milk in and have a blast! What can go wrong?

	<br>
	<h3> Just Drink the Milk </h3>
	Milk is healthy! <br>
 	It is a very nice source of protien and gives you lots of Vitamin F as in you should feel good about it! Tons of benefits from just drinking the milk in the bowl! <br>
Just make sure the milk is freshly squeezed from a cow that has eaten tons of freshly fertilized grass!
